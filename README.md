# marky-markdown 

The thing npmjs.com uses to clean up READMEs and other markdown files

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install marky-markdown --save
```

## Usage

```js
var marky = require("marky-markdown")

// Clean up a regular old markdown string
var html = marky("# hello, I'm markdown").html()

// Or pass in an npm `package` object to do stuff like:
// - rewrite relative URLs to their absolute equivalent on github;
// - normalize package metadata with redundant readme content;
var html = marky("# hello, I am the foo readme", {
  package: {
    name: "foo"
    name: "foo is a thing"
    repository: {
      type: "git",
      url: "https://github.com/kung/foo"
    }
  }
}).html()

```
